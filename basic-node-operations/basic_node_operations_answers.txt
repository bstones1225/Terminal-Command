###Questions

>1.Run the commands `sort`, `wc` and `uniq` on the commands.js file. Explain how they work and what the output was.

A: `sort` sorts the actual code line by line. 'wc' gives newline, word, and byte counts for a file. `uniq` sorts but doesnt print duplicate lines.

>2.Using the pipe (|) connect at least two commands and run it on commands.js. Explain what the output was and why the specific data was outputted.

A: `sort commands.js | cat` has the contents sorted and then printed. `cat commands.js | sort` prints the contents, then sorts. `uniq commands.js | cat` removes the duplicates then prints the content of the file.

>6.In this checkpoint, you encountered built-in JavaScript methods as well as the new ES6 syntax. Review the information below before attempting the programming challenge.


```
//the reverse command
	 "r": function(stringName) {
       const inputArray = stringName.toString().split("");
       const reverseArray = [];
       inputArray.forEach((element) => {
 		console.log(element);
           reverseArray.push(element);
           console.log(reverseArray);
           
	 });
       reverseArray.reverse();
       console.log(reverseArray.join(""));
       
   },
